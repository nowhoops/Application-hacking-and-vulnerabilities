# H1 Scope First, Controls Later


## 1. In-Scope Components

This ISMS scope covers my personal home network and homelab environment that I use for studies, learning, and hobby projects. The scope includes the infrastructure, devices, services, and information that I own and actively manage.

### Network and Infrastructure
- Router/firewall providing connectivity between the home network and the internet
- Two Internet Service Providers (dual ISP setup)
- Wireless access point (AP)
- Three 10G 8-port switches
- One 1G 24-port switch
- Internal LAN and VLANs used for servers, clients, and lab environments

### Servers and Systems
- Proxmox virtualization server hosting:
  - Gaming virtual machine
  - Hobby/lab virtual machines
  - School/study virtual machines
- Network Attached Storage (NAS) for file storage and backups
- Dedicated server running various self-hosted services
- Home Assistant server for home automation management

### End-User Devices
- Three personal laptops used for studies and administration
- Two personal smartphones (used for access and MFA where applicable)
- TV (only when interacting with Home Assistant or internal services)

### Information Assets
- Course materials and assignments
- Personal notes and documentation
- Source code repositories and lab configurations
- Credentials, SSH keys, VPN keys, and configuration files
- Backups stored on NAS

## 2. Out-of-Scope Components and Justification

The following components are explicitly excluded from this ISMS scope:

- Devices owned or used by family members  
  *Reason:* No administrative control or relevance to study lab.
- Work-related systems and services  
  *Reason:* Managed by employer and subject to separate security policies.
- Rarely used or non-relevant devices  
  *Reason:* Minimal risk and no impact on study objectives.
- Operator-managed infrastructure on the “internet side”  
  *Reason:* Outside my ownership and control; risk is accepted.
- External locations and systems not disclosed  
  *Reason:* Privacy, operational security, or lack of relevance.

## 3. Key Interfaces and Dependencies

### External Interfaces
- Internet connectivity via two ISPs
- Self-hosted VPN for remote access
- SSH access to servers and network devices
- RDP access to virtual machines

### Cloud and Third-Party Services
- Code hosting platforms (e.g. GitHub/GitLab)
- Cloud storage for limited data sharing or backup (if used)
- Learning Management Systems (LMS) for studies

### Suppliers and Providers
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Hardware vendors (servers, switches, network equipment)
- Software and cloud service providers

## 4. Network and Interface Diagram (Simplified)

- My comments on this
- There are problems witht ths set up but that happens when you build your set up part by part for five years. The fixes like redundant firewall.


## B) Interested Parties and ISO 27001 Mapping


| Interested Party | Need / Requirement | ISO 27001 Reference (Clause / Area) | How to Demonstrate Compliance (Evidence) |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Myself | Data retention, availability of services, confidentiality and privacy of personal data | 4 Context of the organization / 5 Leadership / 6 Planning / 8 Operation | Backups on NAS, redundant internet connection (dual ISP), RAID storage, documented home lab maintenance and configuration logs |
| Family Members | Privacy, minimal disruption from lab activities | 5 Leadership (ownership responsibility) / 8 Operation | Network segmentation (VLANs for lab vs personal use), controlled access to servers and Wi-Fi, firewall rules to limit lab traffic impact, documented policies for lab usage |
| Cloud / Software Services (GitHub, Google Drive, etc.) | Account security (MFA, strong passwords), data confidentiality, availability of code or study materials | 6 Planning / 8 Operation / 9 Evaluation | MFA enabled screenshots, repository access logs, backup copies of critical code, documented access and permission policies |
| Internet Service Providers (ISPs) | Reliable connectivity, service continuity, compliance with contractual obligations | 6 Planning / 8 Operation | ISP contracts, uptime monitoring logs, network performance statistics |
| Educational Institution / LMS | Access to course content, protection of login credentials, compliance with academic integrity | 8 Operation / 9 Evaluation | LMS login records, secure authentication configuration, screenshots of course access |
