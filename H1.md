# H1 Scope First, Controls Later


## 1. In-Scope Components

This ISMS scope covers my personal home network and homelab environment that I use for studies, learning, and hobby projects. The scope includes the infrastructure, devices, services, and information that I own and actively manage. 
# a) Basic scope

- ISP
- Wireless access point (AP) x2
- Three 10G switches
- One 1G 24-port switch
- Vm server 
- Nas
- Mgmt server
- Security system (camera, motion detection and door/windows sensors)


### Servers and Systems
- Virtualization server hosting:
  - Gaming VM
  - Hobby/lab VM
  - School/study VM
- (NAS) for file storage and backups
- Dedicated server running various self-hosted services

### End-User Devices
- Three personal laptops used for various task
- Two personal smartphones I use 2FA with local device.
- TV

### Information Assets
- Course materials and assignments
- Personal notes and documentation
- Photos & Videos

## 2. Out-of-Scope Components and Justification

I left out my off-site hardware and anything I don’t want to disclose.

- Devices owned or used by family members  
  *Reason:* No administrative control or relevance to study lab.
- Work-related systems and services  
  *Reason:* Security policies.
- Rarely used or non-relevant devices  
  *Reason:* impact on study objectives( plus there is a lot of them).
- Operator-managed infrastructure  
  *Reason:* Outside my ownership and control
- External locations and systems that I don't want to disclosed  
  *Reason:* Privacy, operational security, or lack of relevance.

## 3. Key Interfaces and Dependencies

### External Interfaces
- ISPs
- Self-hosted VPN for remote access
- SSH access to servers and network devices
- RDP access to virtual machines

### Cloud and Third-Party Services
- FOr Code (e.g. GitHub/GitLab)
- School LMS 
### Suppliers and Providers

## 4. Network and Interface doodle
- Here is the proof.
- I wasn’t sure what other evidence to provide, as I don’t want to publicly share the software I use.
- This screenshot is from my UniFi Controller.

## B) Interested Parties and ISO 27001 Mapping
 Interested Party
## Myself
**Needs:**  
Dedicated hardware is required for testing and lab activities, as well as reliable hardware for school use. There must be sufficient and secure storage space to back up all important data. Fast data transfer speeds are required within t storage. The system must allow quick creation of new virtual machines when needed for exercises.  

**Expectations:**  
Easy but secure access to data at all times. Security is a priority, ensuring systems and data are protected from unauthorized access. Backups are expected to be reliable and restorable. The environment should operate smoothly without major interruptions. If one location is wiped the data can be restored fully with in 24h. Fysical security is sufficient.  

**Requirements:**  
The environment must be highly available with minimal downtime. Backup storage must be encrypted and regularly updated. The lab environment must be logically separated from other home network devices. Sufficient disk space must be maintained to ensure safe and reliable backups. Some security testing is used. Fysical security is sufficient.  

## Family Members
**Needs:**  
The home network must be available and provide reliable internet access for daily use.  

**Expectations:**  
The network to be secure and protected against common web threats.  

**Requirements:**  
The lab environment must be isolated from family devices, and the home network must be secured with basic protections such as a firewall and secure Wi-Fi settings.  

## My comppany
**Needs:**  
The company needs reliable IT systems, servers, and network infrastructure to ensure smooth daily operations. Critical business data must be available when required, with minimal downtime. There must be sufficient storage and backup systems to protect all company data.  

**Expectations:**  
The systems to be secure from unauthorized access, malware, and cyber threats. Expect fast and stable network performance for productivity.  

**Requirements:**  
Strong authentication (password policies) must be implemented for all systems. Regular data backups to be done and securely stored. Critical servers and networks must be monitored for SECINC. Sensitive data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit, and access must be limited to authorized personnel only.  

## ISP
**Needs:**  
Stable network connectivity and proper operation of customer devices.  

**Expectations:**  
Responsible use of the network without harming other users or violating terms of service.  

**Requirements:**  
Secure network configuration, compliance with ISP policies, and prompt reporting of any issues.



### Collection of evidence:
- "Establish and implement procedures for the
identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of evidence related to
information security events." Quote from the  ISO27001-2023
- Keep records backed ups
- monitored for unauthorized physical access.
- Off-site assets will be proteced
- Written policies and workflows for handling security incidents.
