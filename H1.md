# H1 Scope First, Controls Later


## 1. In-Scope Components

This ISMS scope covers my personal home network and homelab environment that I use for studies, learning, and hobby projects. The scope includes the infrastructure, devices, services, and information that I own and actively manage. 
# a) Basic scope

### 1) Network and Infrastructure
- Router
- firewall 
- ISP
- Wireless access point (AP) x2
- Three 10G switches
- One 1G 24-port switch
- Vm server 
- Nas
- Mgmt server
- Security system (camera, motion detection and door/windows sensors)


### Servers and Systems
- Virtualization server hosting:
  - Gaming VM
  - Hobby/lab VM
  - School/study VM
- (NAS) for file storage and backups
- Dedicated server running various self-hosted services

### Devices Used in Course Exercises
- Two  laptops used for various task
-  smartphones.


### Information
- Course materials and assignments from Application Hacking moodle
- Personal notes and documentation in my on nas
- Photos & Videos in my own nas
- Source code repositories and lab configurations (Github)
- SSH keys, VPN keys, and configuration files
- Terokarvinen.com

## 2. Out-of-Scope Components and Justification
Scope of the Home Lab Environment
This home lab is limited to devices and services that I control within my own network. This includes personal computers, servers, and networking equipment like switches, routers, and firewalls. The lab also covers virtual machines and containers that I host locally for experimentation,  Cloud services and third-party platforms that directly support my learning like GitHub for code management and the school LMS (moodle) for coursework, are included. The main goal of the lab is to explore network setups, deploy services, and test security measures in a controlled, self-managed environment. 
What components are explicitly out of scope? Devices used by family members are excluded because I don’t control them and they aren’t relevant to the lab. Work systems are also excluded due to organizational security policies. Also rarely used or unrelated devices are left out to reduce complexity. Infrastructure managed in any external locations or systems  I just don’t want to disclose are also outside the scope, mainly for privacy, security, and relevance reasons.
The lab relies on several key external interfaces. Internet access comes through my ISP, and I use a self-hosted VPN, SSH connections to servers and network devices, and RDP ‚ VNC for virtual machines. 
Conceptually, the network can be divided into in-scope (home network and lab devices) and out-of-scope (external networks, things that I don’t want to disclose and services like ISP or githun) areas.

## B) Interested Parties and ISO 27001 Mapping
 Interested Party
## Myself
**Needs:**  
Dedicated hardware is required for testing and lab activities, as well as reliable hardware for school use. There must be sufficient and secure storage space to back up all important data. Fast data transfer required within t storage. The system must allow quick creation of new virtual machines when needed for exercises.  

**Expectations:**  
Easy but secure access to data at all times. Security is a priority, ensuring systems and data are protected from unauthorized access. Backups are expected to be reliable and restorable. The environment should operate smoothly without major interruptions. If one location is wiped the data can be restored fully with in 24h. Fysical security is sufficient.  

**Requirements:**  
The environment must be highly available with minimal downtime. Backup storage must be encrypted and regularly updated. The lab environment must be logically separated from other home network devices. Sufficient disk space must be maintained to ensure reliable backups. Some security testing is used. Fysical security is sufficient.  

## Family Members
**Needs:**  
The home network must be available and provide reliable internet access for daily use.  

**Expectations:**  
The network to be secure and protected against common web threats.  

**Requirements:**  
The lab environment must be isolated from family devices, and the home network must be secured with basic protections such as a firewall and secure Wi-Fi settings.  

## My comppany
**Needs:**  
The company needs reliable IT systems, servers, and network infrastructure to ensure smooth daily operations. Critical business data must be available when required, with minimal downtime. There must be sufficient storage and backup systems to protect all company data.  

**Expectations:**  
The systems to be secure from unauthorized access, malware, and cyber threats. Expect fast and stable network performance for productivity.  

**Requirements:**  
Strong authentication (password policies) must be implemented for all systems. Regular data backups to be done and securely stored. Critical servers and networks must be monitored for SECINC. Sensitive data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit, and access must be limited to authorized personnel only.  

## ISP
**Needs:**  
Stable network connectivity and proper operation of customer devices.  

**Expectations:**  
Responsible use of the network without harming other users or violating terms of service.  

**Requirements:**
