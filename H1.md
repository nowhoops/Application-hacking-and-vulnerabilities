# H1 Scope First, Controls Later


## 1. In-Scope Components

This ISMS scope covers my personal home network and homelab environment that I use for studies, learning, and hobby projects. The scope includes the infrastructure, devices, services, and information that I own and actively manage. 
# a) Basic scope

### 1) Network and Infrastructure
- Router
- firewall 
- ISP
- Wireless access point (AP) x2
- Three 10G switches
- One 1G 24-port switch
- Vm server 
- Nas
- Mgmt server
- Security system (camera, motion detection and door/windows sensors)


### Servers and Systems
- Virtualization server hosting:
  - Gaming VM
  - Hobby/lab VM
  - School/study VM
- (NAS) for file storage and backups
- Dedicated server running various self-hosted services

### Devices Used in Course Exercises
- Two  laptops used for various task
-  smartphones.


### Information
- Course materials and assignments from Application Hacking moodle
- Personal notes and documentation in my on nas
- Photos & Videos in my own nas
- Source code repositories and lab configurations (Github)
- SSH keys, VPN keys, and configuration files
- Terokarvinen.com

## 2. Out-of-Scope Components and Justification
Scope of the Home Lab Environment
- This home lab is limited to devices and services that I control within my own network. This includes personal computers, servers, and networking equipment like switches, routers, and firewalls. The lab also covers virtual machines and containers that I host locally for experimentation,  Cloud services and third-party platforms that directly support my learning like GitHub for code management and the school LMS (moodle) for coursework, are included. The main goal of the lab is to explore network setups, deploy services, and test security measures in a controlled, self-managed environment. 
- What components are explicitly out of scope? Devices used by family members are excluded because I don’t control them and they aren’t relevant to the lab. Work systems are also excluded due to organizational security policies. Also rarely used or unrelated devices are left out to reduce complexity. Infrastructure managed in any external locations or systems  I just don’t want to disclose are also outside the scope, mainly for privacy, security, and relevance reasons.
- The lab relies on several key external interfaces. Internet access comes through my ISP, and I use a self-hosted VPN, SSH connections to servers and network devices, and RDP ‚ VNC for virtual machines. 
Conceptually, the network can be divided into in-scope (home network and lab devices) and out-of-scope (external networks, things that I don’t want to disclose and services like ISP or githun) areas.

### Collection of evidence:
- Here is the proof.
- I wasn’t sure what other evidence to provide, as I don’t want to publicly share the software I use.
