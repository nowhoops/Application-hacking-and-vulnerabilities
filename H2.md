h2 Break & Unbreak (Tero)

Now we hack! And code!

You'll learn to find and fix vulnerabilities.

Remember systematic working methods and report as you go. Also reflect: Where could this vulnerability be common? How could this mistake be avoided? What did I learn from this?

    x) Read/watch/listen and summarize. (In this x-subsection, you don't need to do tests on a computer; just reading or listening and a summary is enough. A few bullet points are sufficient for the summary.)

    a) Break into 010-staff-only. See Karvinen 2024: Hack'n Fix
    b) Fix the 010-staff-only vulnerability from source code. Demonstrate with a test that your solution works.
    c) Solve dirfuzt-1 from the article Karvinen 2023: Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf. This helps in solving 020-your-eyes-only.
    d) Break into 020-your-eyes-only. See Karvinen 2024: Hack'n Fix
    e) Fix the 020-your-eyes-only vulnerability. Demonstrate with a test that your solution works.
    g) Optional. Introductory exercise that helps solve 010-staff-only. Solve Portswigger Academy's "Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data".
    h) Optional. Introductory exercise that helps solve 010-staff-only. Solve Portswigger Academy's "Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass"
